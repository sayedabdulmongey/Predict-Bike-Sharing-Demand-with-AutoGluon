# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

## Overview
Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.
In this project,i will use the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition in Kaggle. I will be using Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition.

In this project, I use the AutoGluon library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle. The objective is to predict the number of bike rentals in a given hour based on historical usage patterns. AutoGluon's tabular prediction capabilities allow me to efficiently handle the dataset provided by the competition and achieve high predictive accuracy.

## Project Approach

### Initial Model Training

I began by training a baseline model using the provided dataset. The initial score was a starting point, but it wasn't satisfactory. This indicated the need for further improvements.

### Feature Engineering

To enhance the model's performance, I conducted feature engineering. This involved creating new features from the existing data to better capture the underlying patterns and relationships. As a result of these efforts, I observed a significant improvement in the model's predictive accuracy.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

To further refine the model, I employed hyperparameter tuning on AutoGluon's models. By adjusting the hyperparameters, I was able to optimize the performance and achieve an even higher score. This step was crucial in fine-tuning the model to reach its full potential.

## Results

Throughout the project, the combination of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning led to a progressive improvement in the model's performance. Each iteration brought me closer to an optimal solution, demonstrating the power of AutoGluon in handling tabular prediction tasks efficiently.

I also wrote a report detailing the best models at each step, the scores achieved, and the specific hyperparameters used. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the project's development and the improvements made at each stage.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of iterative improvements in machine learning. By leveraging AutoGluon's capabilities, I was able to develop a robust model for predicting bike sharing demand. The process involved training a baseline model, enhancing it through feature engineering, and fine-tuning with hyperparameter adjustments. This approach can be applied to various predictive modeling tasks, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of AutoGluon.

## Future Work

Future work may include exploring additional features, experimenting with other machine learning frameworks, and deploying the model for real-time prediction to further validate its practical applicability.
